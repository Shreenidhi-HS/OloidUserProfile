    scanPolicy:"The terms of this Facial Scan Policy describes how Oloid Inc (“Oloid”) treats facial scan data extractedn from photos. Oloid, acting as a service provider to the company that owns or operates the website or app that you are using or is providing the services you wish to access (“Company”), extracts facial scan data from your selfie photo or video and stores it, in order to help verify your identity for all future transactions. Oloid may also use your information, including your facial scan data, to detect and prevent fraud, and to authenticate your identity for future identity verifications. The images of you obtained from selfies, videos, or identity documents and facial scan data are collected, used, and stored directly by Oloid on behalf of Company as Company’s service provider through Company’s website or app that you currently are using. Oloid securely stores all selfies, videos, photos of identity documents, and facial scan data in an encrypted format. Oloid’s third-party vendors may have access to the facial scan data to store the data, to maintain backup copies, and to service the systems on which such data is stored. Consistent with our directions from the Company, Oloid will permanently destroy your facial scan data when directed to do so by the Company, unless otherwise required by law or legal process to retain the data. Oloid uses the reasonable standards of care within its industry to store, transmit, and protect from disclosure your facial scan data, in a manner that is the same as or more protective than the manner in which it stores, transmits, and protects other confidential and sensitive information. Oloid will not sell, lease, trade, or, other than to provide the verification and authentication services to Company described in this policy, otherwise benefit from facial scan data. Other than as set forth herein, Oloid will not disclose, redisclose, or otherwise disseminate facial scan data unless doing so: A. Completes a Company transaction requested and authorized by you or your legally authorized representative; B. Is required by state or federal law, or municipal ordinance; C. Is required pursuant to a warrant or subpoena issued by a court of competent jurisdiction; or D. Is expressly consented to by you. By clicking on the “Accept” button or otherwise proceeding to use the services Oloid provides on behalf of Company, you agree that you have read, understand, and voluntarily consent to Oloid’s Facial Scan Policy, and that you release any claims related to your facial scan data." ,
